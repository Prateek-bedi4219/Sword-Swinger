Welcome to my 3D Game - Sword Swinger

In this game, you, the king, have to fight with it's own mirror in a mirror world. The Story is as follows - 
Once upon a time, there was a powerful emperor in a distant, war-torn land. There existed a mystical artifact known as the Mirror of Soulsâ€”an ancient relic said to reveal the true essence of anyone who gazed into it.

The emperor sought the mirror, driven by personal goals: whether to seek power, redemption, or revenge. He believed that the mirror would give him the wisdom and strength he needed to rule forever, or perhaps help him atone for his past misdeeds.

However, when he gazed into the mirror, something unexpected happened. Instead of seeing the world or the people he once knew, he was confronted with an exact copy of himselfâ€”a reflection of his deepest fears, regrets, flaws, and insecurities. This reflection did not merely mirror his face, but embodied all the dark aspects of his soul.

The reflection challenged the emperor, asking questions like, "Do you truly think you can defeat me?" and "You are meâ€”your past, your guilt, your selfishness. Can you defeat yourself?"

The emperor battles fiercely against his reflection, but with each strike, the reflection only grows stronger. Exhausted and on the verge of defeat, the emperor begins to realize the truth: the reflection is not an enemy to be vanquished, but a part of himself that he has been fightingÂ forÂ tooÂ long.
